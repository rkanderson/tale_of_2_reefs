# run_model()
# runs model and returns a dataframe with all data produced throughout the simulated periods.
# Paramater list:
  # E1: vector of fishing effort for reef 1 throughout all periods
  # E2: vector of fishing effort for reef 2 throughout all periods
  # max_effort: maximum effort allowed across both reefs for any given time period
  # initial_stock: initial stock of fish in each reef (same for both)
  # carrying_capacity: carrying capacity of each reef (same for both)
  # r: intrinsic population growth rate coefficient for the fish species
  # q: catchability coefficient for the fish species
  # z: migration coefficient for the fish species
  # num_periods: number of time periods to simulate
  # rho: discount rate for present utility
  # util_scaling_constant: scaling constant for present utility
# Returns: 
#   dataframe with columns for stock1, stock2, reproductive_growth_1, reproductive

# until it reaches depleteion (less than the gamma threshold) at which point we switch to the other reef.
# This will be done in a loop until the end of the simulation period.
