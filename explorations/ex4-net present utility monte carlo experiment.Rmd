The goal of this exploration is to try to run the optimization of the fishery model
but many iterations with values sampled from various distributions.
The goal will be to get a confidence interval for the net present utility of the fishery model.

To get this done, we'll create a function that runs the monte carlo on a set of inputs. it will perform the sampling from the distrubituons, run the optimizations, collect the values. Then it will return the values for further analysis.
